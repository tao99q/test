    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Our vision has always been to do the best work possible for our clients. What has changed is the ways we can
        achieve that. We’ve been a digitally-focused agency from the start, so we’ve had the opportunity to watch as
        digital evolved and evolve alongside it. And no matter where the industry has gone, we’ve used each new
        innovation as a way to better connect our clients with their consumers.</p>

    <p>Digital advertising is a completely different animal than it was when we began. It’s not just that technology has
        changed, but the ways that brands use technology to connect with consumers has changed, as has the nature of the
        basic brand-consumer relationship. </p>
    <p>We’re fortunate that we started right in the midst of this shift, so an evolving landscape almost feels like home
        to us. </p>
